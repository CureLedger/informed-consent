# Ginger Science SPF Research Registry  
**Informed Consent v.1.0**

The Ginger Science SPF Research Registry collects information from participants regarding sun protection product use, experiences, and preferences to better understand and address the unique sun protection needs of individuals with red hair and the MC1R genetic variant.

Registries collect and store data about specific characteristics from individuals with shared traits or conditions. By participating, you contribute valuable insights that help researchers and product developers create safer, more effective sun protection products tailored specifically for redheads.

People with the MC1R variant have unique sun protection needs due to increased sensitivity to UV radiation. Today's technologies enable us to harness this information, leading to better research outcomes and improved products.

## How does the Ginger Science SPF Research Registry work?

De-identified information regarding your sun protection product use, preferences, experiences, and related health data will be securely stored and used for research and product development purposes. The registry aims to improve understanding of sun protection effectiveness specifically for people with the MC1R gene variant. Additionally, this registry addresses practical needs, such as improving product recommendations and personalized skincare advice.

Researchers and product developers will access the registry to gather accurate data on sun protection usage, efficacy, and preferences among redheads. Researchers seeking participants for relevant studies and product testing will also use the registry.

There is **no cost** to participate in the registry.

## Optional: Conditional Reidentification for Follow-Up Research or Personalized Feedback

As part of the Ginger Science SPF Research Registry, your information is stored in a de-identified format. This means we remove personal details so that your identity is not linked to your responses in the research database.

In some cases, researchers may want to follow up with participants to share findings, offer new research opportunities, or provide personalized insights. To make that possible, we ask for your optional consent to allow reidentification of your record under specific conditions.

**By opting in, you agree to the following:**

- I consent to my de-identified data being re-linked to my identity only by authorized registry staff under secure and limited circumstances.
- I understand that this reidentification would be used solely to contact me for follow-up research, personalized feedback, or product testing invitations.
- I understand I may revoke this consent at any time by notifying the registry.
- I understand that my contact information will not be shared with third parties without my explicit, additional consent.

There are no penalties for declining this option, and your data will still be fully included in the registry and used for research in de-identified form.

- [ ] **YES, I consent to conditional reidentification for the purposes described above.**
- [ ] **NO, I prefer to remain fully de-identified and will not be contacted for follow-up.**
